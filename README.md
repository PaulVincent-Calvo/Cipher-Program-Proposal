## Significance

### History 
Governments, military organizations, and private individuals have all utilized ciphers to communicate secret messages throughout history.

### Cryptography
Cryptography is the science of making information secure. It is utilized in many different contexts, such as secure communication, digital signatures, and cybersecurity. Ciphers are a fundamental component of modern cryptography which is why it is an essential area of study. 

### Confidentiality and Security
Ciphers are used to encrypt messages and render them unreadable to unauthorized parties, preserving confidentiality and guarding against interceptions and theft of important information. Additionally, they are utilized in numerous security systems, including online banking and e-commerce, to restrict access and safeguard critical information.

## How it Contributes to [UN's SDG](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/sustainable-development-goals/ "Sustainable Development Goals")
The Cipher Program contributes to these 4 United Nation's Sustainabe Development Goals (SDG). 

### [**Good Health and Well-Being**](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3 "SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being")
  
The Cipher Program promotes Good Health and Well-Being by providing a sense of security and privacy in communication since protecting personal information is essential especially in today's age where cyber threats are prevalent.

### [**Quality Education**](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal4 "SDG 4: Quality Education")

The project cultivates Quality Education by encouraging critical thinking skills and enhancing problem-solving skills, enhancing digital literacy, and supporting interdisciplinary learning. It encrourages critical thinking skills and enhances problem-solving skills because the program involves the use of complex algorithms that require these skills to understand it. Furthermore, it also enhances digital literacy as it can help people learn the basics of encryption and data security. Lastly, it supports interdisciplinary learning since it requires knowledge from various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and linguistics.

### [**Decent Work and Economic Growth**](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8 "SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth")

It nurtures Decent Work and Economic Growth by enhancing cybersecurity which can allow businesses to operate more securely increasing consumer trust that can lead to economic growth. Moreover, it also promotes the protection of intellectual property such as trade secrets, patents, and coprights. The protection of these also allow for businesses to avert security threats that can also lead to economic growth.

### [**Industry, Innovation, and Infastructure**](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal9 "SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infastructure")

The project contributes to Industry, Innovation, and Infastructure by encouraging collaboration as it requires knowledge in multiple fields of study. Moreover, it may also be used by businesses to encrypt their messages as they communicate with one another to be sure that nothing they say gets leaked.  By fostering collaboration and partnerships, innovations and progress can be achieved.
